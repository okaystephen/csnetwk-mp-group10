## How to run

### Windows machine
1. To run server, you can click the `run.bat` file on the server folder and the same with the client.
2. You can also try running them in separate command lines, just follow the commands in the `run.bat` which is
```
%DIRECTORY%/server> run
```
```
%DIRECTORY%/client> run
```

### Linux/Mac Machines
1. To run the server and client, just follow the commands in the `run.sh` which is
```
<DIRECTORY>/server$ .\run.sh
```
```
<DIRECTORY>/client$ .\run.sh
```

## Additional Features
> **Safely Close the Server Window.**

You can safely exit the server by typing
```
... some logs here ...
quit
```
and it will stop the serversocket and some threads on the background.
> **Client will be closed if the server was closed**
